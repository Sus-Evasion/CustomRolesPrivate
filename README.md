### Ability List
Below is a table of all the current abilities, followed by a description of them. 

AbilityName | Type | Duration | Cooldown | Description
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :------
ActiveCamo | Active | 30s | 90s | Turns the user invisible when used. While invisible they may interact with objects, use items, and throw grenades without breaking their invisibility, however shooting a gun or starting to charge a micro will break their invisibility early.
Charge | Active | N/A | 45s | Causes the player to charge forward in a straight line very quickly. Upon colliding with a solid object, or another player, the user of the ability is ensnared for 5 seconds. If they collided with another player, that player is also ensnared for the same duration, and take 15 damage (if the player was not moving at the time, this value is doubled). If instead they collide with a non-player object (such as a wall/door), the user takes 15 damage instead.
HealingMist | Active | 15s | 3min | Every 1 second for the duration, all friendly players within 12ft of the user will be healed for 6 health. When the duration expires, any allies within that range are also given 45 AHP. Neither the heal, nor the AHP are applied to the user of this ability, however they can be affected by another player's use of this ability.
HealOnKill | Passive | Up to 10s | N/A | Heals the player for 2.5 health every second for 10 seconds after they kill another player. Taking damage while this effect is active will cancel the remaining duration. (If the heal over time option is disabled, all of the healing is done instantly, and damage taken will not prevent it)
Martyrdom | Passive | N/A | N/A | When the player dies, an HE grenade will explode on their corpse.
MoveSpeedReduction | Passive | N/A | N/A | Slows the player's movement speed by 30%.
Projectile | Active | N/A | 35s | Launches a projectile in the direction the player is facing. Upon reaching it's destination, it will explode like a grenade.
ReactiveHume | Passive | N/A | N/A | A special type of Hume shield that degenerates over time, instead of regenerating. When the player takes damage, the hume will gain 75% of the raw damage before any reductions are applied. Damage taken by the player is reduced based on how full the hume is, up to 80% reduction when the hume is full. The damage reduction calculation is done **PRIOR** to the hume gaining value from the attack.
SpeedOnKill | Passive | 5s | N/A | When the player kills another player, they will gain an intensity level of SCP-207 for the duration. This effect can stack multiple times, up to the configured limit. Getting kills while at the intensity limit will NOT refresh the duration.
Jammer | Active | 0.1s | 180s | Launches a SCP 2176 at targeted location
Sprint | Active | 10s | 90s | Player gains unlimited sprint within ability duration and runs even faster
